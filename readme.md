## Core Architecture
An MCP agent is essentially a loop that facilitates a conversation between the Gemini model and your Go functions. The model "thinks," decides on an "action" (a tool call), your code executes it, and the result (an "observation") is fed back to the model to inform its next thought.

Your Go application will manage these four key components:

Gemini Client: An official Go client to communicate with the Gemini API.

Tool Definitions: Go structs that describe your available functions to the Gemini model.

Agent Core Loop: A for loop that manages the conversation, sending messages and tool results back and forth.

Tool Dispatcher: A mechanism (like a switch statement) that calls your actual Go functions based on the model's request.

## Step-by-Step Implementation in Go
Let's build a simple agent that can get the current weather.

### Step 1: Project Setup and Authentication
First, get the official Google Go SDK for the Gemini API.
```
go get google.golang.org/api/aiplatform/v1beta1
```
You'll need to authenticate. The easiest way for local development is to use the gcloud CLI:
``
gcloud auth application-default login
```
### Step 2: Define Your Go Function and its Tool Schema
First, write your standard Go function. Then, you must create a *aiplatform.Tool object that describes this function to the Gemini API.

### Step 3: Build the Agent Core Loop
This is the heart of the MCP agent. The loop continues until the model provides a final text response instead of another tool call.

## Key Considerations for Go Engineers
Concurrency: If you have tools that make slow network calls (e.g., database queries, external API calls), run them in separate goroutines. This keeps your agent responsive and is a natural fit for Go's concurrency model.

Strong Typing: Use Go's structs to define the arguments for your tool functions (var args struct{...}). This allows you to safely unmarshal the JSON arguments from the model, providing type safety and compile-time checks.

Error Handling: Go's explicit if err != nil pattern is perfect for building reliable agents. Wrap every API call and tool execution with proper error handling to manage failures gracefully.

State Management: For more complex agents, you'll need to manage state beyond just the conversation history. A struct for your agent can hold user session data, task progress, and other contextual information.
